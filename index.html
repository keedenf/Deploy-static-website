    <p>
        For as long as I can remember I've always been curious about what goes 
        on behind the screen, though I never had the opportunity to study 
        software engineering growing up. I took it upon myself to find a way to 
        learn despite having very little prior experience to programming. As 
        with most people, once I found that one thing I enjoyed, I began to 
        gravitate towards it through software engineering videos on youtube 
        and conversations about programming with like-minded people. It was 
        then when the spark was ignited.<br><br>
        I started working straight after my matric year and began saving in 
        order to fund my studies through HyperionDev. Despite the adversities
        I faced along the way, working a full-time job and staying up late to 
        push out assignments. I noticed that, that smothered flame never 
        fizzled out. I realised that this was the path I was going to take and 
        nothing could get in-between that. Since that realisation that flame 
        has only burned brighter and I'm excited to see where my drive to 
        further my knowledge takes me.

            Working on a farm, I learnt to adapt to the fast-paced, 24/7 nature 
            of it. I honed the ability to keep up with deadlines while tending 
            to urgent matters that pop up along the way. I was most fond of the
             opportunities to modernise workflows in creative and innovative 
             ways, creating a smoother and more productive environment for both
            my colleagues and for me.
